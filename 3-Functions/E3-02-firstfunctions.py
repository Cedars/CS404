# Topic 3: Functions
# Exercise 3-02

# Name: <# Your Name Here #>

# 3-02-firstfunctions-solution.py

#-------------------------------------------
# Instructions:
# 	This program has two stub methods called do_something() and do_another_thing()
#	They currently do nothing. You have to replace the text between 
#	and including the <#...#> signs with code.
#
#	Be careful with your indentation! Functions stop with the first line that is not
#	indented under the def command. Keep your code lined up!
#
#	You have to delete the text from <# to #>, otherwise your program will break!
#	Those placeholders are not valid Python.
#
#	Note that when you run this program, it will not produce any output.
#	The purpose of this exercise is to get a program that runs without errors first.
